# R-CheatSheet

## Useful packages

### dplyr
 - glimpse (show the structure in a way that is easy to understand and well enough formatted so you can look at it in the console window)
 - filter (find rows/cases where conditions are true. Unlike base subsetting, rows where the condition evaluates to NA are dropped.)

### tidyr

- Spread and gather data, which means transform a data frame from wide into long format or the opposite
- seperate (split character column)
- unite (join character column)
